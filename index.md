Independent ML researcher using deep learning to solve interesting problems and casually explore to what extent Artificial Neural Nets can proxy their organic analogues.

Recently completed a project at the intersection of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing.  See the Transcribr post below to learn more about it and be sure to check out the [demo](http://transcribr.net) to see it work in real time.

Spent some years devoted to Ruby building Rails applications and begrudgingly joined the Javascript bandwagon after witnessing the power and flexibility of React.

Shuttered personal projects which entertained nonetheless:
* GoodwillXchange -- idealistic time-bank/complementary currency system
* Thoughtsy -- idealistic thought-sharing social network

Spent a large chunk of time wandering the globe. Now I mostly read, play volleyball, and surf when not thinking about neural nets.
